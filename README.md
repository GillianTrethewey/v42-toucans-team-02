The dropdown menu option allows users to filter the jokes by different categories. Simply click into the dropdown menu to view and select the desired categories. The application will display one joke that is within the selected category.

The keyword search button allows users to filter the jokes to include the keyword. Simply type in a keyword or phrase in the search bar and the application will display one joke containing that keyword.
